# Scaling 

Scaling in machine learning refers to the process of transforming the input features of a dataset so that they have similar numerical ranges or scales. This is important because many machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scaling of input features. When features are at different scales, some features can dominate other features in determining the output of the algorithm, resulting in inaccurate or skewed results.

Common scaling techniques include standardization, in which features are transformed to have zero mean and unit variance, and normalization, in which features are transformed to have a range of values between 0 and 1. Other techniques include logarithmic scaling and min-max scaling. Scaling is an important step in machine learning preprocessing and can improve the accuracy and performance of many machine learning algorithms. Scaling the input features allows the algorithm to treat each feature equally, avoiding dominance or bias that might otherwise occur.
