It is based on the Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of a hypothesis (class label) given the evidence (input features) is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis. In other words, GNB tries to predict the probability of a particular class label given the input features.\n","\n","GNB assumes that the input features are independent and identically distributed, and that their probability distribution follows a Gaussian or normal distribution. This means that GNB assumes that the probability of each feature is independent of the other features, and that their distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped.\n","\n","To train a GNB model, we calculate the mean and variance of each feature for each class label in the training data. Then, during the testing phase, we use these parameters to calculate the probability of each class label given the input features. The class label with the highest probability is then selected as the predicted class label for the given input.\n","\n","GNB is a simple and computationally efficient algorithm that works well for high-dimensional datasets with continuous input features. However, it may not perform well on datasets with correlated features or non-Gaussian distributions."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"0a337d33","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-06T05:28:17.089505Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-06T05:28:17.088702Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-06T05:28:17.098416Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-06T05:28:17.097091Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.027825,"end_time":"2023-05-06T05:28:17.101012","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-06T05:28:17.073187","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["from IPython.display import IFrame"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"572c278e","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.014078,"end_time":"2023-05-06T05:28:17.128979","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-06T05:28:17.114901","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["**Note** - This notebook is higly inspired by this [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) and this [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) video on [Center Limit Theroem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeJD6dqJ5lo)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b0ffaa5a","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.013649,"end_time":"2023-05-06T05:28:17.15774","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-06T05:28:17.144091","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# What we will learn after the end of this notebook\n","* Probablity\n","* Condtional Probablity\n","* Chain Rule In Condtional Probablity\n","* Maximum A Postirier\n","* How Numpy creates and stores Large Empty Arrays in Small Space"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bab0b74b","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.013578,"end_time":"2023-05-06T05:28:17.185134","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-06T05:28:17.171556","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Probablity \n","\n","So what is this term `probablity`\n","\n","Probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event occurring, given some observations of the past. \n","\n","The Probablity $p(x)$ of an event $x$ occuring in $n$ number of events is given by\n","$$p(x) = \\frac {x}{n}$$\n","For example the probablity of `Heads` occuring when a `coin` is tossed is $50$%.
