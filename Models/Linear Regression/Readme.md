# Linear Regression 

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The objective of linear regression is to find the line of best fit that can describe the relationship between the variables.

In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, and the line of best fit is a straight line. In multiple linear regression, there are more than one independent variables, and the line of best fit is a hyperplane.

Linear regression is widely used in various fields, including finance, economics, engineering, and social sciences, to model the relationship between variables and make predictions. It is a simple and efficient method that can be easily understood and applied in practice.

Linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the variables and that the errors are normally distributed with a constant variance. It is important to check these assumptions before using linear regression to ensure that the results are reliable.
