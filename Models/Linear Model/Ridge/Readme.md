# Ridge
Ridge Regression is a regression technique used for handling the problem of multicollinearity, which occurs when there are high correlations among predictor variables in a regression model. In traditional linear regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared differences between the actual and predicted values. However, when multicollinearity is present, the regression coefficients can become unstable, making it difficult to interpret the significance of individual predictors. Ridge Regression addresses this issue by adding a penalty term to the traditional linear regression objective function. The penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, which shrinks them towards zero. This regularization technique helps reduce the impact of multicollinearity and makes the model more robust.

Ridge Regression has several advantages. It can effectively handle multicollinearity, stabilize the regression coefficients, and reduce the impact of irrelevant predictors. Furthermore, it can prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term that discourages large coefficient values. However, one limitation of Ridge Regression is that it does not perform automatic feature selection, meaning it does not directly eliminate irrelevant predictors from the model.
