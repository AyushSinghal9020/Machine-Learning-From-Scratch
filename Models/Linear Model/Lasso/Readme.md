# Lasso

Lasso regression, also known as L1 regularization or L1 norm regularization, is a linear regression technique that incorporates regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the model's interpretability. It is widely used in machine learning for feature selection and regularization. In traditional linear regression, the model aims to minimize the sum of squared residuals between the predicted values and the actual values. However, this can lead to overfitting when the model becomes too complex, especially when dealing with datasets that have a large number of features. Lasso regression addresses this issue by adding a penalty term to the traditional linear regression cost function. The penalty term is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients, multiplied by a regularization parameter called lambda (位). By introducing this penalty, Lasso regression encourages sparse solutions, meaning it tends to set the coefficients of irrelevant or less important features to zero, effectively performing feature selection.

The key advantage of Lasso regression is that it can automatically select the most relevant features, which helps in reducing the dimensionality of the problem and improving the model's interpretability. The resulting model is not only more parsimonious but also less prone to overfitting. Moreover, Lasso regression can handle highly correlated features better than other regularization techniques like ridge regression. The regularization parameter 位 controls the strength of the penalty term. A higher value of 位 increases the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients, leading to more coefficients being set to zero. On the other hand, a lower value of 位 reduces the shrinkage, allowing more coefficients to be non-zero. Lasso regression is widely used in various domains, including economics, finance, and biology. It has proven to be a valuable tool for feature selection and producing more interpretable models. However, it's worth noting that Lasso regression may not perform well when there are a large number of highly correlated features, as it tends to arbitrarily select one feature over others. In such cases, alternative regularization techniques like elastic net regression can be considered.
