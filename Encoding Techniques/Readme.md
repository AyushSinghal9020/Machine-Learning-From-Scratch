# Categorical Encoding 
Categorical coding is a technique used in machine learning to represent categorical data in a numerical form that can be used as input to machine learning models. Categorical data represents non-numeric data such as: For example, the name of the country or the types of products sold in the store.

There are several types of category coding techniques such as one-hot coding, ordinal coding, and target coding. One-hot encoding creates a binary vector for each category, with each element in the vector representing whether the category is present. Ordinal coding assigns a numerical value to each category based on rank or order. Target Encoding calculates the average target value for each category and replaces the category with that value.

Categorical coding is important because many machine learning algorithms require numerical data as input. Transforming categorical data into numerical data makes it easier to process and analyze, and machine learning models can be trained to make predictions based on this data.
