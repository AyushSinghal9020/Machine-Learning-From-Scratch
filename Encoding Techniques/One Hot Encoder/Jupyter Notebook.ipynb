Categorical data represents non-numeric data such as: For example, the name of the country or the types of products sold in the store.\n","\n","There are several types of category coding techniques such as one-hot coding, ordinal coding, and target coding. One-hot encoding creates a binary vector for each category, with each element in the vector representing whether the category is present. Ordinal coding assigns a numerical value to each category based on rank or order. Target Encoding calculates the average target value for each category and replaces the category with that value.\n","\n","Categorical coding is important because many machine learning algorithms require numerical data as input. Transforming categorical data into numerical data makes it easier to process and analyze, and machine learning models can be trained to make predictions based on this data.\n","\n","So what is an `encoding technique`???\n","\n","Lets assume we have a `dataset` like this \n","\n","|CGPA|Languages Known|Placement In Ohio|\n","|---|---|---|\n","|6.9|Python|1\n","|4.5|Java|0\n","|8.8|C++|1\n","|9.9|Python|1\n","\n","And now we want to `predict` the `liklehood` of the student being placed with the data like \n","\n","|CGPA|Languages Known|Placement In Ohio|\n","|---|---|---|\n","|7.9|Python|?\n","\n","You would say, that just pass all the data into a machine learning model, and then it will help you to predict the results.\n","\n","But But But\n","\n","There is a problem, Machine Learning model only accept numeircal dataform, not a categorical or `string` data. So how can we display the information in the column `Languages Known`??.\n","One way we can do this is `make seperate columns for the designated values` like this \n","\n","|CGPA|Languages Known|Python|Java|C++|Placement In Ohio|\n","|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n","|6.9|Python|1|0|0|1\n","|4.5|Java|0|1|0|0\n","|8.8|C++|0|0|1|0\n","|9.9|Python|1|0|0|1\n","\n","and then we can drop the column `Language Known` or repalce with this matrix \n","\n","|CGPA|Python|Java|C++|Placement In Ohio|\n","|---|---|---|---|---|\n","|6.9|1|0|0|1\n","|4.5|0|1|0|0\n","|8.8|0|0|1|0\n","|9.9|1|0|0|1\n","\n","and can do the same for the testing data\n","\n","|CGPA|Python|Java|C++|Placement In Ohio|\n","|---|---|---|---|---|\n","|7.9|1|0|0|?\n","\n","Now we can feed this data into any model and expect results\n","\n","So what we just learned is an encoding technique called `One Hot Encoding`. Here we treat every value as same and distinct, so every value is equal and then we encode them\n","\n","\n","\n","Now comes another question. How can we actually do this\n","\n","**How** - So there are as usual two ways to implement the transformer\n","\n","* **Using specialized libraries** - Obviously one of the all rounder library the `scikit-learn` gives us the ability to easily apply a transformer on any custom function you want\n","\n","* **Making your own encoders** - You can always make stuff by yourself, this gives you a `lot
