In machine learning and classification problems, the top-k accuracy is a performance metric used to measure how many of the top-k predicted classes for a given input match the actual class. It is particularly useful for evaluating models in multi-class classification problems, where the goal is to correctly predict the class of an input from a set of possible classes.

The top-k accuracy is calculated by first obtaining the k most likely predictions for each input from the model, and then checking if the actual class is one of those top-k predictions. If the actual class is among the top-k predictions, the model is considered to have made a correct prediction for that input.

For example, if k=3 and the model predicts the top three classes as A, B, and C, and the actual class for the input is A, then the model is considered to have made a correct prediction.

The top-k accuracy metric is useful in scenarios where the exact class label is not as important as correctly identifying the possible classes that the input might belong to. It is often used in recommendation systems, where the goal is to suggest the top-k items that a user might be interested in, and in natural language processing, where the model needs to identify the top-k most likely next words in a sentence.

In general, the higher the top-k accuracy, the better the model's performance, as it correctly identifies more of the top-k most likely classes for each input.
