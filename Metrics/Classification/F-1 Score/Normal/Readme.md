The F1 score is a measure of a classification model's accuracy and is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is commonly used in binary classification problems where there are two classes, but it can also be used in multi-class classification problems.

The F1 score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible score. A score of 0 means that the model has completely failed to predict correctly, while a score of 1 means that the model has predicted all instances correctly.

The F1 score is a useful metric to evaluate a model's performance, especially when the classes are imbalanced. It is often used in combination with other metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, to provide a more comprehensive view of a model's performance.

In summary, "F-1 Score Normal" is not a commonly used term in data science, and there is no known definition or explanation for it.
