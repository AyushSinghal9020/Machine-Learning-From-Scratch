# Top K Accuracy
In machine learning, top k accuracy is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It measures the proportion of test samples for which the true class label is among the k predicted classes with the highest predicted probabilities.

For example, if k = 3, the model's prediction is considered correct if the true class label is among the top 3 predicted labels by the model. This metric is useful when the model outputs a set of possible class labels with their corresponding probabilities, rather than a single most likely label.

Top k accuracy is especially useful when dealing with multi-class classification problems, where the number of classes is large and the model's predictions may not always be perfectly accurate. By allowing for a small number of possible correct answers, top k accuracy provides a more forgiving measure of performance than standard accuracy.

Overall, top k accuracy is a useful metric for evaluating the performance of machine learning models, particularly in complex classification tasks where the correct answer may not always be clear-cut.
