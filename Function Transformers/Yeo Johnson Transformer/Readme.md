# Yeo Johnson Transformer

Yeo-Johnson transformation is a power transformation technique used for data normalization, scaling, and to handle skewed data distributions in statistical analysis and machine learning.

The Yeo-Johnson transformation is a modified version of the more common Box-Cox transformation, and it can handle both positive and negative values. The transformation works by applying a power function to the data that depends on a tuning parameter Î».

The Yeo-Johnson transformation has several advantages over other transformations. First, it can handle both positive and negative values, which is useful when working with data that includes both positive and negative values. Second, it can handle zero and negative values, which is useful when working with data that includes zero values. Third, it can handle skewed data distributions, which is useful when the data has a non-normal distribution.

In summary, the Yeo-Johnson transformation is a flexible and powerful tool for data normalization and handling skewed data distributions in statistical analysis and machine learning.
