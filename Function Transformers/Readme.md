# Function Transformer


The Numerical Function Transformer is a data preprocessing technique used to apply mathematical functions or transformations to numerical features in a dataset. It allows for the creation of new features derived from existing numerical variables, potentially capturing complex relationships and improving the performance of machine learning models. The Numerical Function Transformer operates by applying a specified function or transformation to each numerical feature individually. This function can be a predefined mathematical function, such as logarithm, square root, or exponential, or a custom function defined by the user. The resulting transformed values replace the original values in the dataset.
  
|______|______|
|---|---
|Enhanced feature representation|Applying mathematical transformations can uncover complex relationships and patterns within numerical features that might not be apparent in their original form.
|Normalization and scaling|Transformations like logarithm or square root can help normalize skewed distributions and scale the numerical features to a more desirable range.
|Non-linear relationships|The transformed features can capture non-linear relationships between variables, allowing machine learning models to better learn and generalize from the data.
|Improved model performance|By providing more informative and representative features, the Numerical Function Transformer can potentially enhance the performance of machine learning models, leading to more accurate predictions.

The Numerical Function Transformer can be applied in various domains, including finance, healthcare, image processing, and natural language processing, where numerical variables often require appropriate transformations to extract meaningful information and patterns.
